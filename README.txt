This repository contains random programs I create while learning OpenMP. Programs will be written in c or c++. Programs containing more than one file will be contained in a separate directory. Descriptions of programs are as follows: 

forpi.c - calculate the integral of 4/(x^2+1) from 0 to 1, should equal pi, using the “pragma omg parallel for reduction” construct

mptest.c - calculate the integral of 4/(x^2+1) from 0 to 1, should equal pi, using
“pragma omg parallel” and “pragma omg critical” constructs.
